# vkmz version 1.0 

vkmz is a metabolomics vizualization tool which creates van Krevelen diagrams from mass spectrometry data. A van Krevelen diagram (VKD) plots a molecule on a scatterplot by the molecules oxygen to carbon ratio (O:C) against it's hydrogen to carbon ratio (H:C). Classes of metabolites cluster together on a VKD [0]. Plotting a complex mixture of metabolites on a VKD can be used to briefly convey untargeted metabolomics data.


## Using vkmz

vkmz is designed to use XCMS [1] data as input. Tabular data can also be used as input. For each feature in the data vkmz attempts to predict it's molecular formula by comparing the features mass to a database of known formula masses. Heristically generated databases for unlabeled and labeled data is included with vkmz. Users can define their own database. A VKD is created from formulas with predictions and outputed as a webpage and tabular file.

### Input modes

vkmz has three input modes:
  1. `xcms` mode takes a tabular representation of the [XCMS](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/xcms.html) [1] datamatrix
  2. `tsv` mode takes a specially formatted tabular file
  3. `plot` mode takes vkmz tabular data that was generated by a previous run of the tool

Select a mode by declaring it as the first argument to `vkmz.py`. *eg.*
```
python vkmz.py xcms [OTHER PARAMETERS]
```

Different modes take different parameters.

All modes require an output parameter:
  * `--output [FILENAME]`
    * A `.tsv` and/or `.html` will be generated by vkmz with this paraameter as the file name.

All modes allow these optioal parameters:
  * `--plot-type [{scatter-2d}]`
    * Select plot type
  * `--size [INTEGER]`
    * Set base size of marker dots of the VKD
  * `--size-algorithm [{1,2,3,}]`
    * Choose algorithm to modify marker size
      1. Uniform base size
      2. Relative feature log intensity

#### xcms and tsv modes

Both xcms and tsv mode require the mass error, in parts-per-million, of the mass spectrometer which generated the intial data:
  * `--error [INTEGER]`

There are several optional parameters for xcms and tsv modes:
  * `--database [DATABASE_FILE]`
    * default is BMRB's monoisotopic heuristically generated database [2]
  * `--directory [TOOL_PATH]`
    * define tool directory
  * `--multiprocessing`
    * Call parameter to enable multiprocessing
  * `--no-plot`
    * Disables html file generation

#### xcms mode

xcms mode required tabular files generated by XCMS:
  * `--data-matrix [XCMS_DATA_MATRIX_FILE]`
  * `--sample-metadata [XCMS_SAMPLE_METADATAFILE]`
  * `--variable-metadata [XCMS_VARIABLE_METADATAFILE]`

##### xcms mode example:
```
python vkmz.py xcms --data-matrix test-data/datamatrix.tabular --sample-metadata test-data/sampleMetadata.tabular --variable-metadata test-data/variableMetadata.tabular --output report --error 3
```

#### tsv mode

tsv mode requires a tabular file of a specific format as input.
  * `--input [TSV FILE]`

The first five columns of tabular input must be:

| sample ID | polarity | mz | retention time | intensity |
|-----------|----------|----|----------------|-----------|

#### plot mode

plot mode reads previously generated vkmz tabular files to create VKD html files. Specify the vkmz tabular with with:
  * `--input [VKMZ_TSV_FILE]`
